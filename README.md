# beilinsoncubicquartic.gp
PARI/GP code to numerically verify Beilinson's conjecture for elliptic curves over cubic and quartic number fields as explained in the last section of the paper $K_2$ OF FAMILIES OF ELLIPTIC CURVES OVER NON-ABELIAN
CUBIC AND QUARTIC FIELDS

* compareregLZ7(a) 

  numerically verify Beilinson's conjecture for elliptic curves with 7-torsion over the cubic fields generated by a root of x^3+ax^2+(-a-1)x+1

* compareregLZ8(a) 

  numerically verify Beilinson's conjecture for elliptic curves with 8-torsion over the cubic fields generated by a root of x^3+ax^2+(-a-1)x+1

* compareregLZ10(a) 

  numerically verify Beilinson's conjecture for elliptic curves with 10-torsion over the quartic fields generated by a root of x^4+ax^3-ax+1;

* compareregLnontorsion(a,l) 

  numerically verify Beilinson's conjecture for elliptic curves over the cubic fields generated by a root of x^3+ax^2+(-a-1)x+1 with three K2 elements not necessarily supporting on torsion points. The parameter l equals 1,2,3,4 as $\lambda$ in the paper.

Tables of the families in the paper $K_2$ OF FAMILIES OF ELLIPTIC CURVES OVER NON-ABELIAN CUBIC AND QUARTIC FIELDS written explicitly as functions of X and a. We list the values of $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ for which the polynomial becomes reducible, the Galois group becomes smaller and $Q[X]/(f_a(X))$ is not totally real.
