# Beilinson-elliptic-cubic-quartic
PARI/GP code to numerically verify Beilinson's conjecture for elliptic curves over cubic and quartic number fields as explained in the last section of the paper K2 OF FAMILIES OF ELLIPTIC CURVES OVER NON-ABELIAN
CUBIC AND QUARTIC FIELDS

* compareregLZ7(a) 

  numerically verify Beilinson's conjecture for elliptic curves with 7-torsion over the cubic fields generated by a root of x^3+ax^2+(-a-1)x+1

* compareregLZ8(a) 

  numerically verify Beilinson's conjecture for elliptic curves with 8-torsion over the cubic fields generated by a root of x^3+ax^2+(-a-1)x+1

* compareregLZ10(a) 

  numerically verify Beilinson's conjecture for elliptic curves with 10-torsion over the quartic fields generated by a root of x^4+ax^3-ax+1;

* compareregLnontorsion(a,l) 

  numerically verify Beilinson's conjecture for elliptic curves over the cubic fields generated by a root of x^3+ax^2+(-a-1)x+1 with three K2 elements not necessarily supporting on torsion points. The parameter l equals 1,2,3,4 as lambda in the paper.
